# In-Play-Betting-Loss-Minimization

Generally, an individual bets on a sports match before the game starts. The initial odds for both teams are presented. With in-play betting, one can bet on the match as it occurs. Depending on how the match plays out, the odds for both teams will change. 

In a match consisting of Team 1 and Team 2, let's say I bet on Team 1 before the match starts. Then, during the middle of the match, I can also bet on Team 2 with its changed odds. In this way, I can most likely bet in such a way that at worst, my bet results in even. 

To use, create a variable and store it to first_bet() to hold onto initial team odds, total amount bet on which team, and total amount of money that you have. Then, for additional bets, run later_bets() with the parameter being the variable used to store first_bet().

Some tests are also written out in comments. This is still a work in progress.
